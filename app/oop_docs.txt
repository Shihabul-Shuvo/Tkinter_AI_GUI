OOP FEATURES IN THIS PROJECT

- Multiple inheritance: ImageCaptionWrapper(BaseModelWrapper, PreprocessMixin)
- Decorators: @timing, @simple_cache on process methods
- Encapsulation: private-ish attributes _model_name, _pipeline, _loaded, _last_time
- Polymorphism: BaseModelWrapper.process is abstract; subclasses implement specific behavior
- Method overriding: load() and process() overridden in each wrapper
- Mixins: LoggingMixin and PreprocessMixin provide cross-cutting concerns
